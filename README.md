# [Drag-And-Drop-Project-App](https://qur786.github.io/Drag-And-Drop-Project-App/)
## Description
A Drag and Drop App built with Typescript to manage status of projects. It is a very simple App that let's us create Projects with information such as **Title, Description, No. of people assigned to the project**.
In this App, A Project can be of two types:
1. Active
2. Finished

So, when a developer needs to create an Active project he can directly create it with **Add new Project Form** and when the Project gets finished he can drag it from Active Projects to 
Finished projects.

## Motivation Behind this project
So, I created this project with the help of a online course on Typescript.So, to learn and use various **Typescript** concepts I have created this simple **Drag and Drop App**.

## Technologies Used
I have used following **tools and technologies** to build this project
1. Typescipt
2. NodeJS
3. CSS
4. HTML
5. live-server
6. VSCODE


## How to use this Project
1. Pull every file from the main branch of this repository into your local system
2. Open up your command line interpreter ( bash - Linux, CMD - Windows)
3. Go to the folder where you have store all these files
4. Run yarn or yarn install to install all the dependencies.
5. Build the files either running **yarn tsc -w** or run **yarn build** to compile the TS files into JS files in watch mode.
6. Start the server by running **yarn start** command, after few seconds it will open the app in localhost:8080 in your browser.
7. Now create new projects/tasks, drag and drop them according the status of the project
